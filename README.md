#CLIPS Syntax Highlighter for Sublime Text

## What's this thingie?

This package provides syntax highlighting for the language used in [CLIPS] [1], a forward chaining production system in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

The origins of the C Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS) date back to 1984 at NASA's Johnson Space Center. More info at [CLIPS History](http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/WhatIsCLIPS.html#History)

## Sublime Text 2 Installation

### With Sublime Package Control

I recommend using the excellent [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) to install Sublime Text 2 packages.

Once you have Package Control installed, activate your Command Palette and choose ```Package Control: Install Package```.

Then, search for **CLIPS Rules* and press Enter. In mere moments you'll be up and running with full syntax highlighting, tab completion and more. Huzzah!
